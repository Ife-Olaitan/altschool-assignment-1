<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi! I’m Ifeoluwa Olaiya — a frontend developer and UX designer currently training in Cloud Engineering at ALT School Africa.
    I have a strong foundation in creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces, with hands-on experience in tools
    like Figma, Adobe XD, and technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
</p>
<p>
    While I’ve spent the past few years designing and building user-facing applications, I joined ALT School to deepen
    my understanding of what happens behind the scenes — how applications are hosted, scaled, and maintained in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
    I’m passionate about building complete, scalable solutions that don’t just look good but work seamlessly under the hood.
    By combining my frontend expertise with cloud engineering, I aim to bridge the gap between user experience and system reliability.
</p>

<h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
<p>
    I joined AltSchool to transition into cloud engineering and become a more well-rounded developer. As someone with a
    background in UX and frontend development, I realized that to truly deliver end-to-end solutions, I needed to understand
    infrastructure, deployment, and DevOps practices.
</p>
<p>
    AltSchool’s cloud engineering track stood out for its hands-on approach and industry-relevant curriculum. I’m excited
    to learn about cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, and gain practical experience in managing servers, CI/CD pipelines,
    containerization, and system monitoring.
</p>

<h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Master cloud engineering concepts including infrastructure as code, networking, and DevOps practices</li>
    <li>Combine my frontend skills with backend and cloud knowledge to build full-stack applications</li>
    <li>Gain real-world experience through collaborative projects</li>
    <li>Develop key soft skills like communication, collaboration, and leadership</li>
    <li>Contribute to meaningful open-source or community-driven projects</li>
    <li>Prepare for certifications and job opportunities in DevOps or Cloud Engineering</li>
</ul>
